# Zen, in-app firewall for Java | by Aikido
Zen, your in-app firewall for peace of mindâ€“ at runtime.

Zen is an embedded Web Application Firewall that autonomously protects your Java apps against common and critical attacks.

Zen protects your Java apps by preventing user input containing dangerous strings, which allow SQL injections. It runs on the same server as your Python app for easy installation and zero maintenance.

## Installation
WIP: Download the zip file [here]() and store it in a directory (e.g. `/opt/aikido-zen`).
Then provide the path to this directory in the environment variable `AIKIDO_DIRECTORY`.
Write access to this directory is required.
